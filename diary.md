# Development diary

 - Created new repository
 - Downloaded ffmpeg. On my Windows dev machine, it's in ../ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe
 - Checked out a couple of old repositories where I do similar things:
   - https://github.com/atornblad/coding-video
   - https://github.com/atornblad/code-streamer

 - `dotnet add package System.Drawing.Common`
